<h1>Why read a novel when you have netflix?</h1>
<p> Since we’re all sick of talking about red states vs. blue states, let’s take a break and switch to a different metric. How about book states vs. movie states? Or dance states vs. museum states? </p></br>
<p>Those sort of breakdowns are found in a pair of studies just released by the <a href="https://www.arts.gov/"> National Endowment for the Arts</a>, which track participation in the arts on both the national and state level. Though the research includes some fun findings, it also confirms at least one troubling trend: We’re increasingly less likely to read literature.</p></br><p>According to the NEA, the share of adults who report reading literature has steadily fallen in recent years, from 47 percent in 2012 to 45 percent in 2013 and 43.1 percent in 2015.</p>
